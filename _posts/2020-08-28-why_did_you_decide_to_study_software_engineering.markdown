To understand why I am passionate about coding languages and the powers that be, it is important to bring up my first career. I graduated from Indiana University and found myself working in Finance. The group I worked with for nearly ten years traded heavily in the currency options markets in Chicago. The nature of the industry is strongly tied to numbers and, more importantly, the industry was dependent on models that are made up of those numbers. Our firm employed their own IT group to help facilitate the code for the traders front end systems. Once a week, we had a chance to meet and discuss needs, and they would return back to us a release in a few days. Unfortunately for me, this was my favorite part of the job towards the end, and the trading industry and its appeal was not fulfilling. But my curiosity and joy of discussing code and design and funcitonality of software with our IT department was no doubt activating and fascinating.

Currently I am in school in Portland, OR. I have two terms left until I graduate with a BFA in Graphic Design. Due to the pandemic, I felt that this was a far better use of my time because the alternative is going to attending Zoom classes which simply are not as effective when it comes times to print and critique. This program fits perfectly into my schedule as I hope to return to my BFA track when I wrap up my Flatiron program. The combined curriculum of the BFA and the code certification will prepare me for an incredible future.

The possiblities are literally endless. I know I can contribute and improve our society by leveraging software and applications for the greater good. Lastly, it is addicting. My need for logic and reason makes for a perfect fit.
