This project uses a CLI to interact with a user. Throughout the UX, the program communicates with a data source API. During the beginning stages of this project I spent most of my time interacting with the various endpoints provided by the API data source. I learned about the anatomy of the responses that were sent back to my program. I found wo useful API calls to API endpoints.

/players/id

This allowed me to acquire player profile cards.

/season_averages/seaons=2018&player_ids[ ]=283&..

This allowed me to acquire player stats from a particular season, which was a nice natural scope setter for my program.
