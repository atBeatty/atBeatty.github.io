This project uses a CLI to interact with a user. Throughout the UX, the program communicates with a data source API. During the beginning stages of this project I spent most of my time interacting with the various endpoints provided by the API data source. I learned about the anatomy of the responses that were sent back to my program. I found wo useful API calls to API endpoints.

/players/id

This allowed me to acquire player profile cards.

/season_averages/seaons=2018&player_ids[ ]=283&..

This allowed me to acquire player stats from a particular season, which was a nice natural scope setter for my program. After I was able to get myself nested in the data set provided by the API, I went in to the UX game design. I had done a relatively good job in pursuing a finished product, however, my first attempt was a hideous and smelly code. Going forward I will certainly put more time in the blueprint and flow of the data structure. I immediately came to realize that without much outline or guide it is hard to accomplish any sort of scale. 

Think like a developer, not a user.

I have to start adopting a framework for my programs that are built with the developer in mind. I have never been short of empathy towards UX. But, as I become more of a seasoned developer it will be imperative to see empathy in my fellow developers in order to accomplish scale.
