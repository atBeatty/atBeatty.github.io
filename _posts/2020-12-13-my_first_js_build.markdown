I approached this project with enthusiasm because I knew it was going to provide an opportunity to JavaScript. Until this project, I have only used vanilla JS in consoles and a few functions to help change basic CSS styling on some old websites I built. With this project, It is thrilling to finally begin to see the power of JavaScript, and its ability to give developers granular control of web applications. 

## "The answer is always 'yes'"

I think my cohort lead, Corinna, said it best during class. As I built out my project I quickly realized how flexible JavaScript can be. The initial commits of my project appear textbook and guided by class examples. My models and controllers are constrcuted with the Rails Scaffolding generator, and within a day of work I had a functioning, dual-repository, front- and back-end, Rails API wenb application.

From the beginning of this project ,I signed myself up for quite a lofty task. As a side note, if I had to do this over I would build out a simpler model. I chose to incorporate two has_many through relationships and I got into some enigmatic coding scenarios. 

My biggest challenge was creating the chained/nested onboarding process which has the user selecting a course, creating a fourseome object with golfers, then  rendering a wolf-game page. As soon as I allowed myself to experiment with data being passed and responded to, I saw a preview of what JS could do. As a tool, I learned that JS makes developers flexible and creative. I was able to pass around, what I think is, a totally custom data from events that are initiated by custom selectors.

My database and models were quite convaluted and I worried that it was going to take away from what I could potentially learn from a truer, simpler JS concept. But, due to the complex nature I was forced to find a way. If some related data model has an array that I needed to update, like I did with my golf hole each time, it could be done after hours of experimenting with rendering data with JavaScript.
